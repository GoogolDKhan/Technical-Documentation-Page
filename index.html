                    Heat exchange between flowing fluids is one of the most important physical process of
                    concern, and a variety of heat exchangers are used in different type of installations, as in
                    process industries, compact heat exchangers nuclear power plant, HVACs, food processing,
                    refrigeration, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The purpose of constructing a heat exchanger is to get an efficient method
                    of heat transfer from one fluid to another, by direct contact or by indirect contact. The heat
                    transfer occurs by three principles: conduction, convection and radiation. In a heat
                    exchanger the heat transfer through radiation is not taken into account as it is negligible in
                    comparison to conduction and convection. Conduction takes place when the heat from
                    the high temperature fluid flows through the surrounding solid wall.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The conductive heat transfer can be maximized by selecting a
                    minimum thickness of wall of a highly conductive
                    material. But convection is plays the major role in the performance of a heat exchanger.
                    Forced convection in a heat exchanger transfers the heat from one moving stream to another
                    stream through the wall of the pipe. The cooler fluid removes heat from the hotter fluid
                    as it flows along or across it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of the examples of heat exchangers are:

                    These kinds of heat exchangers are mainly made up of circular coils whereas many different
                    shapes are also used for different applications. They provide flexibility because the
                    geometric parameters such as length, diameter can be modified easily.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These are used for phase change such as condensation, evaporation kind of operations.
                    Again, it is classified in to three different categories i.e.
                    double pipe heat exchanger, spiral tube heat exchanger and
                    shell and tube heat exchanger.

                    These are the simplest heat exchangers used in industries. These heat exchangers are cheap
                    for both design and maintenance, making them a good choice for small industries. In this
                    kind of heat exchanger, two tubes or pipes having different diameters are placed
                    concentrically, the smaller one inside the larger one. The two fluids, in between which heat
                    transfer is required, flows in the two different tubes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The curvature of the tube gives rise to a
                    secondary flow which makes the flow turbulent and increases the heat transfer rate. The
                    utilization, conversion, and recovery of energy in commercial, industrial, and domestic
                    applications usually involve a heat transfer process such as refrigerator, air conditioner etc.
                    Improved quality of heat exchanger above the usual practice can significantly improve the
                    thermal efficiency as well as the economics of their design and production.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It has been
                    observed that heat transfer rate in helical coils heat exchanger are higher than that of a
                    straight tube. They are also compact in size. For this helical coil heat exchangers are
                    being widely used in many industrial applications such as nuclear industries, power
                    generation, process plants, refrigeration, heat recovery systems, food industries, etc. The
                    reason behind higher heat transfer rate of helical heat exchanger is that, due to the swirl flow
                    in a coiled tube, centrifugal forces arises which gives rise to secondary flow pattern. It
                    consists of two vertices perpendicular to the axial flow direction. As a result, the heat
                    transfer takes place by diffusion in the radial direction and by convection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The contribution of the convective heat transfer dominates the overall process and significantly
                    enhances the heat transfer rate per unit length of the tube, as compared to the heat transfer
                    rate of a straight tube of equal length. Also, the coiled tube heat exchanger can provide a
                    larger heat transfer area per unit volume having compact size.

            <p>
                Convective heat transfer is the transfer of heat from one place to another by the movement
                of fluids due to the difference in density across a film of the surrounding fluid over the hot
                surface. Through this film heat transfer takes place by thermal conduction and as thermal
                conductivity of most fluids is low, the main resistance lies there. Heat transfer through the
                film can be enhanced by increasing the velocity of the fluid flowing over the surface which
                results in reduction in thickness of film.

                    <li>Helical coils give better heat transfer characteristics, since they have lower wall
                        resistance & higher process side coefficient.</li>
                    <li>The whole surface area of the curved pipe is exposed to the moving fluid, which
                        eliminates the dead-zones that are a common drawback in the shell and tube type
                        heat exchanger.</li>
                    <li>A helical coil offers a larger surface area in a relatively smaller reactor volume and a

                    <li>The spring-like coil of the helical coil heat exchanger eliminates thermal expansion
                        and thermal shock problems, which helps in high pressure operations</li>
                    <li>Fouling is comparatively less in helical coil type than shell and tube type because of

                    <li>Helical coils are used for transferring heat in chemical reactors because the heat
                        transfer coefficients are greater in helical coils as compared to other configurations.
                        This is especially important when chemical reactions have high heats of reaction are
                        carried out and the heat generated (or consumed) has to be transferred rapidly to
                        maintain the temperature of the reaction. They are used widely in petroleum
                        industries for different applications.</li>
                    <li>The helical coils have a compact configuration, and because of that they can be
                        readily used in heat transfer application with space limitations, for example, marine
                        cooling systems, central cooling, cooling of lubrication oil, steam generations in
                        marine and industrial applications.</li>
                    <li>The helical coiled heat exchangers are used widely in food and beverage industries,
                        like in food processing and pre-heating, pasteurization of liquid food items, and for
                        storing them at desired temperatures.</li>
                    <li>Used in hydro carbon processing for the recovery of CO2, cooling of liquid
                        hydrocarbons, also used in polymer industries for cooling purposes.</li>
